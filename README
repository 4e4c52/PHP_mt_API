This class covers all the functions of the Media Temple API v1.0 (beta) as published on 2/14/2011.
Please notice that this is not an official Media Temple work.

For more informations, see http://wiki.mediatemple.net/w/Category:API

The class is divided into two parts. The first covers the Services API, the second the Stats API.

*** How does it works? ***

Just instanciate the object passing your API Key and optionnaly your service ID:
$mt = new MtAPI('FbDgBldQMoKLwIXsBwq...', XXXXX); // Where XXXXX is an int

You can set your Service ID at anytime by calling the following method :
$mt->set_service_id(YYYYY); // Where YYYYY in an int

You can access some technicals informations with the following methods:
$url = $mt->servicesAPI(); // Return the URL of the Services API
$url = $mt->statsAPI() // Return the URL of the Stats API
$code = $mt->lastStatusCode(); // Return the last HTTP code (int)
$call = $mt->lastAPICall(); // Return the last API URL called

*** Services API ***

Add a service:
$result = $mt->add_service(int service_type [[,string $primary_domain], [int $os]]);

List of available os:
$os = $mt->get_os_list();

List of available services:
$services = $mt->get_available_services();

List of your services:
$services = $mt->get_services_list();

List of your services ids:
$ids = $mt->get_services_ids();

Details of your service (your service id must be set):
$details = $mt->get_service_details();

Reboot your service (your service id must be set):
$result = $mt->reboot_service();

Change Plesk password (your service id must be set):
$result = $mt->set_plesk_password(string $password);

Change root password (your service id must be set):
$result = $mt->set_root_password(string $password);

Add temporary disk space (your service id must be set):
$result = $mt->add_temp_disk();

Flush firewall rules (your service id must be set):
$result = $mt->flush_firewall();

*** Stats API ***

Get current stats (your service id must be set):
$stats = $mt->get_current_stats();

Get a range of stats (your service id must be set):
$rangeStats = $mt->get_range_stats(int $start, int $end [, int $resolution [,int $precision]]);
// Where $start and $end are a number of seconds since Epoch

Get a predefined range of stats (your service id must be set):
$rangeStats = $mt->get_predefined_range_stats(string $range);
// See http://wiki.mediatemple.net/w/(mt):Get_predefined_range_stats#Request_Info for a list of supported ranges (ex: 5min, 1hour, ...)

Get warnings (your service id must be set):
$warnings = $mt->get_warnings();

Get warnings thresholds (your service id must be set):
$warnigsThresholds = $mt->get_warnings_thresholds();

That's it!

Have fun with the API.
